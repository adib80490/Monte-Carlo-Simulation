# Monte-Carlo Simulation of Resonant Frequency of an LC Oscillator

Monte-Carlo Simulation of Resonant Frequency of an [LC Oscilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit).

The resonant frequency of an LC Oscillator can be calculated with the following formulat:

The capcitor and the inductor can have a different tolerances. The simulation will generate random capacitance and inductance values within their given tolerance ranges, calculate the resonant frequency and place it in a bin.
